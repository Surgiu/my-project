# Previous Work

The following is a list of previous work that has been done in the field of 3D point cloud semantic segmentation:

- **[xMUDA](https://github.com/valeoai/xmuda)**: xMUDA is a domain adaptation method for 3D point cloud semantic segmentation that uses a cross-modal alignment strategy to align the feature distributions of the source and target domains.
- **[PointNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00593)**: PointNet is a deep learning model for processing point clouds that directly consumes point cloud data without the need for voxelization or image projection.
- **[PointNet++](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02413)**: PointNet++ is an extension of PointNet that introduces hierarchical feature learning to capture local and global features in point clouds.
